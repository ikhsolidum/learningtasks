<p style="font-family:Bahnschrift Condensed; font-size: 30px; color: black; margin: auto"><b><i> Strict Compliance To The Law </b></i></p>
</br>

<img src="law.png" width= "100" height= "100" style="float: left"> <p style="font-family:Bahnschrift Condensed; font-size: 20px; color: black; margin: auto"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first step in addressing this long overdue problem is to have a strict
adherance to the law. Republic Act 9003, or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, mandates that all open dumpsites 
must be converted into sanitary landfills. According to a 2018 study done by eco-business, there are only 139 operational sanitary landfills servicing 
just 308 of the countryâ€™s 1,634 LGUs, and at least 425 illegal dumpsites still operate across the country. On the other hand, RA 9003 also states
that every village or cluster of villages must set up a materials recovery facility (MRF) where biodegradable waste is converted into fertilizer, recyclable material is recycled or sold to junk shops,
and residual waste is collected for transport to sanitary landfills. But data taken from the same study, concluded that out of the country's 
<u><b>42,036</u></b> villages, only 24% or <u><b>10,088</u></b> villages have functional MRF facilities. It seems that the government has not given the required 
amount of attention to this, as this continues to be a pressing concern up to this day. </p>

A proper format of passing a simple letter of recommendation to the incumbent Philippine officials whereas they should fund the construction of these MRFs. Based on the data show earlier,
a whopping below 50% villages in the country have a fully functioning MRF facilities. As we know, these facilities convert biodegradable waste into fertilizers, they also recycle
recyclable materials or sold to junkshops, and residual waste are then transported into several landfills.

This problem that we have often starts from the lack of knowledge concerning proper waste management. We must remember that we, the consumers, are responsible for the waste that we 
throw. Some who possess adequate knowledge towards proper riddance of waste already somehow and in someway contributes to the main objective, which is to get rid of waste in a 
proper way. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. More people does not even know that they are destroying their environment, while some knows the results of their actions, they still
do it out of their sheer ignorance. Seminars should be conducted to educate people in villages and towns. Television Advertisements will also be a huge factor since most families have 
TV's in their homes. As we know, repetition is a good way to plant something in a person's mind. Tarpaulins should also be hanged in areas that are susceptible to trash. Areas like
near bodies of water, or simply the streets.
